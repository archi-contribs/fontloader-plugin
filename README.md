## Font Loader plugin for Archi

This plugin allows you to make some fonts available to Archi without having to install them in your OS.
This is especially useful when working on some worporate workstations.

The plugin comes in two versions:
- The bare plugin which will create a `fonts` folder in your `Archi4` user folder.
Put some fonts in this folder and restart Archi.
The fonts will be made available to Archi.
- The plugin with pre-loaded fonts ([Roboto](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto),
[RobotoConsended](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Roboto+Condensed),
[FontAwesome Free](https://fontawesome.com/how-to-use/on-the-desktop/setup/getting-started),
[Numberpile](http://typodermicfonts.com/numberpile/)).
This version also allows you to add your own fonts in the `fonts` folder.

If you want to have your own version of the plugin containing your own set of fonts, then simply download the _bare_ version,
open it with an archive manager such as [7-Zip](https://www.7-zip.org/) (`.archiplugin` files are simple ZIP archives),
and drop your fonts into the `fonts` folder that you will find inside the `org.archicontribs.fontloader_a.b.c.d`).
